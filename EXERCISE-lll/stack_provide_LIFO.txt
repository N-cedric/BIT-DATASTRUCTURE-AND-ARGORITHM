STACK

A stack provides Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) access because it's specifically designed that
wayâ€”its core operations only allow access to one end of the data structure.
Think of it not as a complex property but as a simple, strict rule. 
You can't grab a plate from the middle of a stack; you can only add a new one to the top or take the top one off. 
This fundamental constraint is what defines it.

A stack is defined by two primary operations that enforce the LIFO principle

Push: This operation adds a new item exclusively to the top of the stack.
Pop: This operation removes an item exclusively from the top of the stack.
Because all additions and removals happen at the same single point (the top), 
the last item you push onto the stack is necessarily the first item you will pop off. 
There is simply no operation to access data in the middle or at the bottom without first removing everything above it.
