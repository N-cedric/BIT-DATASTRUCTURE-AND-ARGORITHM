FIFO (First-In, First-Out) ensures equality in aid distribution because it guarantees that 
individuals are served based on the order of their arrival. 
This principle is widely regarded as fair and equitable,
as it rewards those who waited the longest and prevents any form of favoritism or "jumping the queue."

FIFO is a simple concept: the first item to enter a queue is the first item to leave.
2 In the context of aid distribution, this translates to:
The first person to join the line is the first person to receive aid.3
The second person in line is the second to receive aid, and so on.
This system is inherently fair because it treats everyone equally based on a single, transparent metric: time of arrival.

Why It Prevents Inequality
Using a FIFO system for aid distribution prevents several common forms of inequality:
Prevents Favoritism: It makes it impossible for aid workers to give preferential treatment to friends, 
family, or people from a specific group. The line dictates the order, not personal connections.
Discourages Chaos: It removes any incentive for people to push, shove, or fight their way to the front. 
Knowing that the line is the only way to get aid encourages patience and order.
Ensures a Transparent Process: Everyone can see the process in action. 
The person at the front of the line is next to be served, making the distribution process transparent and predictable. 
This builds trust and reduces conflict.
In essence, by removing personal biases and external factors from the distribution process, 
FIFO creates a level playing field where everyone has an equal opportunity to receive aid based solely on their effort to arrive and wait in line.
