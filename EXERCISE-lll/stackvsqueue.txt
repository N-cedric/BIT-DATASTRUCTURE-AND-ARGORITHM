When distributing relief items, a queue is the fairer data structure.

Why a Queue is Fair?

A queue operates on a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle. 
This means the first person to arrive is the first person to receive the items. 
This is generally considered the fairest method for distribution because it rewards those who waited longest.
 It prevents late arrivals from "cutting the line" and ensures that everyone is served in the order they came.
This approach is transparent and minimizes conflicts.

Why a Stack is Not Fair?

A stack operates on a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle. 
If you used a stack for distribution, the last person to join the line would be the first person to receive items. 
This is inherently unfair as it would encourage people to rush to the front of the line to get served,
creating chaos and rewarding those who arrived last, while punishing those who waited the longest.
